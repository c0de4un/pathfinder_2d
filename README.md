# pathfinder_2d
Pathfinding 2D AI example. Based on Lee-Wave algorithm (A*, BFS, Width).

# How-To
1) Data loaded from file.
2) Map printed to the console-output as chars ;
3) path finding ;
4) if path not found, message printed, if it is founded, map with route printed. Each step of the route
have its own number (step-index). Available option is to find route with longest length ;

# Requirements
Only C++ 11 with a few includes.
Map data stored in file, where also start & finish are set.

# Tools
Made with VSCode C++.

# Changes
[1.0]
 - wave-search using C++ vector ;

[1.1]
 - wave-search using C++ stack ;
 - OOP, Factory ;
 - search options (Shortes/Longest, Diagonal) ;
 - Colorizing console-output on Windows ;
